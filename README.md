# US-population-spending-on-entertainment
This research is devoted to analysis of data provided by US Bureau of the Census.
The data is aggregate (for the whole of United States) annual observations for the period 1959 - 2003 on income, 20 categories of consumer expenditure and price index series for these categories. The income and expenditure variables are all measured in $ billion at 2000 constant prices. The price index series are all based with 2000 = 100.

We will provide detail analysis of expenditures on admissions to specified spectator amusements (ADM). It is very interesting to track changes in this type of data because expenditures on entertainment do not apply to essential goods. We can assume that such type of expenditures grows when income increases and vice versa.
